## My process

The process goes as follows, built out using basic html, we use css to style it and make it loop presentable, along with flex box and media queries to make it responsive. Iused css variables to make adding colors to elements simplyer.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- custom css variables




### What I learned

I primaraily wanted to use this project to re inforce some css skills , i managed to achieve this i also wanted to implement the use of css variables to add colors and font family styles.

code snippet im proud of

css
:root{
    /*primary colors*/
    --Dark-Cyan: hsl(158,36%,37%);
    --Cream: hsl(30,38%,92%);

     /*Neautral colors*/
     --Very-Dark-Blue: hsl(212,21%,14%);
     --Very-Grayish-Blue: hsl(228,12%,48%);
     --White: hsl(0,0%,100%);

     /*Font Sizes*/
     --Paragraph-Font-Size: 2rem;

     /*Font Families*/
     --Font-Montserrat: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
     --Font-Fraunces: 'Fraunces', serif;


}



### Continued development

going forward i plan to do more projects like this to nail it down even furthur i also plan on working more on js and react.


### Useful resources

The resources i used where minimal i used previouse projects off the bootcamp i completed to aid me and just information i could remember.
